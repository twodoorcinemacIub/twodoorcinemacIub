  <br> ★ 𓈒　hey, my name's circuse or apo. i'm a little jester from the northeast 
  <br> that enjoys playing a pixelated little pony game. i like horses.
  <br> ✿ 𓈒　my pronouns are it/fog/vir mainly; do not use they on me. strictly an "it"
  <br> for people i do not know. an example: "it is online, i should say hi to fog."
  <br> ✦ 𓈒　my main interests include : umamusume, rats smp, dawko egos, minecraft,
  <br> rock-afire explosion, glass animals, vocaloid, and more.
  <br> ✜ 𓈒　one thing about me is that i have chronic bpd related traits, and this will affect how
  <br> i act. please note that this cannot be helped by me and i am simply trying my best.
  <br> however, don't be afraid as i love interacting. the company is nice.
  <br> ★ 𓈒　i have a major touch/cuddle comfort, it's my favorite thing to do in ponytown.
  <br> cuddling makes my whole day, so never be afraid to sit alongside me.
  <br> ever. i dare you to do it.
  <br> ✿ 𓈒　another thing to mention is that i love regiscouts. they're awesome.
  <br> i like to collect them, to see what silly things await me, to be happy and free.
  <br> some regis i reside in include : cb, bug🐛, tfr, dxsk, and my own, ccr.
  <br> ✦ 𓈒　i think that's really it from me. if (for some reason) you'd like to get
  <br> to know me more; catch me online some time. chatting isn't the easiest
  <br> for me, but it's sure fun. let me get in ya brain, let's talk
